                <h2>Nine Eleven | Politics</h2>
            <p>
                On September 11th, 2001, 4 planes were hijacked. Two of them hit the twin towers located in New York. 
                One of them hit the Pentagon, and the final one did not make it to its destination (thought to be either the White House or Captial Building) due to the heroic sacrfice of the passengers. 
                This event would cause The War on Terror which saw thousands of US soldiers fighting agianst diffrent terrorist groups in the middle east for a little over 2 decades
