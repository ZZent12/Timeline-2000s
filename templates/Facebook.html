            <p>
                When Facebook was created there were social media sites that existed, but Facebook became the first mainstream social media.
                Facebook was so appealing because it was constantly trying to improve its self and it took the risky move of also devloping an app, 
                which at the time cell phones were still mainly used to call people.
